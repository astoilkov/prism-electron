## Why

There is already a `prismjs` `npm` package. What are the advantages of this package then?

- 🐎 
- Prism is 2.1MB and prism-electron is 230KB(the module includes only the core logic and all associated languages, no examples, tests, themes, plugins)
- lazy loading of languages increases start up time by a LOT
